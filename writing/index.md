## Writing

I write often, though not nearly as much as I should. In my spare time, you'll find me answering questions on tech news / trends, imagining the future, exploring social issues, and, of course, chronicling design ideas I like and dislike. Check out the sections below to see some of my more 'popular writing.'

## [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ryan-Borker)

I write on Quora from time to time. In part because it pays better than a lot of other writing. Some of the popular things I've written are about running and tech strategy. 

Some Professionally Relevant Highlights:

### [What is a "product person"](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-product-person)
Not comprehensive, but a line in the sand from my personal experience.

### [What tech company is going downhill?](https://www.quora.com/What-tech-company-is-going-downhill/answer/Ryan-Borker)
Hint: WeWork, called well before late 2019 meltdown.

### [Why did Uber beat Lyft?](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Uber-so-successful-vs-Lyft-Sidecar-etc)
This one got published in Newsweek.

### [How can we improve hiring diversity?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-specific-things-employers-can-do-today-to-build-more-diverse-technical-teams) 
I've spent a lot of time thinking about this at Shortlist.

### [How does Google Search work?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Google-search-work-6/answer/Ryan-Borker)
A simplified answer in layman's terms.

Some other popular answers in the personal realm:

### [What screams "I am new to Silicon Valley"?](https://www.quora.com/What-screams-I-am-new-to-Silicon-Valley/answer/Ryan-Borker)
Unfortunately for me, my only 10K+ upvoted answer.

I do pop culture too.




## [Medium](https:/www.medium.com/@borker)

On Medium, I take a more speculative or reflective approach. Don't expect miracles. I, too, am merely a flawed human.


### [You're better off dead than on Facebook](https://medium.com/@borker/youre-better-off-dead-than-on-facebook-linkedin-or-twitter-d466806544d5) 
I spend a lot of time thinking about how we spend our attention, and whether it's intentional or not. Social media takes a huge share of our most precious resource.

### [How to prepare for your first investor meeting](https://medium.com/listen-to-my-story/checklist-how-to-prep-for-your-first-investor-meeting-c119c0fc74eb)

### [Is the weak tie dead?](https://medium.com/@JoinShortlist/strong-ties-are-more-important-than-ever-bb2136d4dd1f) 
I think weak ties are overemphasized. We need to begin to reform strong ties.

### [Can anyone stop LinkedIn?](https://medium.com/@JoinShortlist/can-anyone-stop-linkedin-hints-from-the-users-911cd653ec23) 
Written from Shortlist's perspective, before the acquisition. I still believe this.
