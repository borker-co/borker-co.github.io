## Shortlist
     
I cofounded [Shortlist](https://www.joinshortlist.com) where I am the COO and Head of Product. 

Top finance companies have (including 7 of the top 30 asset managers) used Shortlist to recruit outstanding individuals to their most senior roles. These roles would otherwise have gone to retained search. 

The Shortlist platform achieved a number of industry firsts: 
- First to receive exclusivity on postings
- First to recruit at the senior level (C-suite, SVP, etc.)
- First vertical 'curated' network for senior level recruiting

FundFire, an industry leading publication for asset management, [profiled us here](http://fundfire.com/c/1243123/138313/managers_dial_tech_scour_senior_talent).


You can find out more about Shortlist's value to people who used it [on the site](https://joinshortlist.com/a/home/im/connector/about), or you can learn more about the [platform itself](https://joinshortlist.com/a/home/im/connector/platform).
